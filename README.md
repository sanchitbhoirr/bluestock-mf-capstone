## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains the completed Capstone Project for the **Bluestock Fintech Data Analytics Internship**.

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end Mutual Fund Analytics Platform using real-world public data from AMFI India and `mfapi.in`.

This README documents the progressive completion of daily milestones, moving from raw data ingestion to structured data engineering, analytics, dynamic Power BI Dashboards, advanced Python recommender systems, and final production automation.

**Phases Completed:** `Day 1` • `Day 2` • `Day 3` • `Day 4` • `Day 5` • `Day 6` • `Day 7` • `Day 8-9`

**Status:** `Completed & Deployed`

---

## 🚀 Day 1: Data Ingestion, API Integration & Quality Validation

### 1. Project Architecture & Setup
- Initialized a standard data science folder structure (`data/raw`, `data/processed`, `notebooks`, `scripts`, `sql`, `dashboard`, `reports`).
- Set up a virtual environment and installed core dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (Pandas, Requests, NumPy, etc.).

### 2. Static Data Ingestion
- Successfully loaded 10 extensive real-world CSV datasets provided by Bluestock (comprising 40 schemes, 4.5 years of NAV history, and 87K+ transaction rows).
- Evaluated dataset schemas, shapes, and data types to prepare for downstream transformation.

### 3. Live API Integration (Live NAV Fetcher)
- Developed an automated Python script (`scripts/live_nav_fetch.py`) to interact with the public `mfapi.in` REST API.
- Dynamically fetched live NAV data for 6 critical benchmark schemes:
  - *HDFC Top 100 Direct (125497)*
  - *SBI Bluechip (119551)*
  - *ICICI Bluechip (120503)*
  - *Nippon Large Cap (118632)*
  - *Axis Bluechip (119092)*
  - *Kotak Bluechip (120841)*

### 4. Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted preliminary exploration of the `01_fund_master.csv` dataset.
- Extracted and mapped unique Fund Houses, Categories, Sub-categories, and Risk Grades to understand the AMFI scheme code structure.

### 5. Data Quality & Validation
- Executed a strict validation protocol to ensure cross-dataset integrity.
- Confirmed a **100% match** by validating that every AMFI scheme code present in the `fund_master` dataset flawlessly aligns with the historical records in the `nav_history` dataset.

---

## 🛠️ Day 2: Data Cleaning & SQL Database Design

### 1. Data Cleaning Pipeline (Pandas)
- **NAV History:** Parsed dates, sorted records by scheme, removed duplicates, and implemented critical forward-filling (`ffill`) logic to handle missing NAV values during weekends and market holidays.
- **Transactions:** Standardized transaction types (SIP, Lumpsum, Redemption), validated positive investment amounts, fixed date formats, and filtered valid KYC statuses.
- **Scheme Performance:** Validated numeric return values, flagged risk anomalies (e.g., negative Sharpe ratios), and enforced acceptable expense ratio ranges.
- Exported all cleaned datasets to the `data/processed/` directory.

### 2. Database Schema Design
- Designed a professional analytical **Star Schema** with dimension tables (`dim_fund`, `dim_date`) and fact tables (`fact_nav`, `fact_transactions`, `fact_performance`, `fact_aum`).
- Authored strict DDL statements (`sql/schema.sql`) defining Primary Keys and Foreign Keys for data integrity.

### 3. Data Loading (SQLAlchemy)
- Created an automated Python pipeline using `SQLAlchemy` to generate a local SQLite database (`bluestock_mf.db`).
- Iteratively mapped, transformed, and loaded tens of thousands of processed records from Pandas DataFrames directly into the structured SQL tables.

### 4. Analytical SQL Queries
- Authored 10 business-critical SQL queries (`sql/queries.sql`) to extract insights such as:
  - Top 5 Fund Houses by AUM.
  - Average NAV trends per month.
  - Total SIP Amount by Year (YoY Growth).
  - Transaction volumes distributed by Fund Category.

### 5. Documentation
- Created a comprehensive Data Dictionary (`data_dictionary.md`) documenting all tables, columns, data types, and business logic to ensure project maintainability.

- Computed **Daily Returns** for all 40 schemes and validated the normal distribution of returns.
- Calculated the **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** for 1-Year, 3-Year, and 5-Year horizons.

### 2. Risk Metrics
- Calculated annualized return and volatility metrics.
- Computed the **Sharpe Ratio** (using a 6.5% risk-free rate) to measure risk-adjusted returns.
- Computed the **Sortino Ratio** focusing solely on downside risk.
- Identified the **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)** for each fund to assess maximum historical loss.

### 3. Alpha & Beta (Market Regression)
- Utilized `scipy.stats.linregress` to perform an OLS regression of fund returns against the market benchmark.
- Extracted annualized **Alpha** (excess return over market) and **Beta** (market volatility correlation).

### 4. Composite Fund Scorecard
- Built a robust 0-100 Fund Scorecard system by applying strategic weights:
  - 30% for 3Y CAGR
  - 25% for Sharpe Ratio
  - 20% for Alpha
  - 15% for Expense Ratio (Inverse)
  - 10% for Max Drawdown (Inverse)
- Ranked and identified the Top 10 mutual funds in the dataset based on this composite score.

### 5. Benchmark Comparison & Tracking Error
- Visualized the Top 5 best-performing funds against the Market Benchmark over a 3-year cumulative growth period.
- Computed the **Tracking Error** to measure how closely the funds follow the benchmark index.

## 🧠 Day 6: Advanced Analytics & Risk Metrics

### 1. Advanced Risk Metrics (VaR & CVaR)
- Computed **Historical Value at Risk (VaR)** at a 95% confidence interval to determine the maximum expected daily loss for each fund.
- Calculated **Conditional VaR (CVaR)** to measure the average loss in worst-case scenarios.
- Visualized the **90-Day Rolling Sharpe Ratio** for top 5 funds to observe dynamic changes in risk-adjusted returns over time.

### 2. Investor Behavioral Analytics
- **Cohort Analysis:** Grouped investors by their first transaction year (2024 vs. 2025). Discovered that while 2024 had higher total investments, the 2025 cohort showed a higher average SIP amount (₹13,505 vs ₹10,996).
- **SIP Continuation Risk:** Analyzed transaction gaps for investors with 6+ SIPs. Successfully flagged investors with average gaps exceeding 35 days as 'at-risk' for potential churn.

### 3. Sector Concentration Risk (HHI)
